        1.	Create the Home page where the assignment question is displayed.<br>
        2.	Create another page name “Story Creation” that takes a form as input from user.
            Form input contains person name, character name, adverb and adjective as text fields. The form contains a button “ Tell Story”.<br>
        3.	it'll be useful to show a default value in all input elements to simplify your testing of the page.<br>
        4.	The form should also have a button element with an ID so that you can attach the event handler to it. It should also have the attribute type="button".<br>
        5.	There should also be a div element with an ID where the story will appear.<br>
        6.	The requirements for the story and its appearance are:<br>
        1.	There must be exactly four input fields, but their meaning is up to you. Give them default values so that the form is easier to test.<br>
        2.	Define a new CSS rule in assign2.css to style all the user-supplied words, so that you can see which words were chosen when the story is displayed. You may use whatever color, font, etc. you wish - just make sure the inserted words are distinguishable from the rest of the story.<br>
        3.	The story must be at least four, but not more than six, sentences long (no longer!).<br>
        4.	There should be 8 missing words in the story, so you will have to use some of the user-supplied words more than once. For example, the person's name was used three times in the sample story (Note that duplicated words are entered only once by the user!)<br>
        5.	Define HTML elements where your JavaScript code will display the values from the form. Think about how you'll target the correct element for the matching value.<br>
        6.	A story title should appear at the top of the story. This story title should include your own name (if you are Aslam, something like “Aslam's Crazy Story!”). Use your story title as the title for your HTML page as      well.<br>
